# Pre–Post Behavioural Analysis Pipeline

This folder contains scripts, data files, and results for analysing **pre post behavioural measures**, including **centering, behaviour comparison demographic correlations, and visualisation**.

The analyses focus on behavioural changes before and after exercise,
relationships between behavioural and demographic variables, and statistical
summaries used for interpretation and visualisation.

The pipeline combines Python-based analyses, derived CSV / Excel outputs,
JASP-based statistical modelling, and scripts for generating publication-ready figures.

## Overview

Main analyses include:

- Pre- vs post-exercise comparisons using connected line plots  
  (analysed separately for **more affected** and **less affected** conditions)
- Relationships between behavioural measures and demographic variables
- Percent change analyses and demographic correlations
- Centering of behavioural variables to reduce collinearity
- Median-split analyses to aid interpretation of GLMM results
- JASP-based statistical models and result files

## Dependencies & Environment

Python analyses are run within a dedicated virtual environment.

- Environment setup and package installation scripts are located in `Scripts/`
- Required Python packages and version specifications are defined there

Please refer to the relevant files in `Scripts/` for instructions on setting up
the environment before running the analyses.

> Note: The `.venv/` directory is not tracked by Git and is created locally.

## Scripts Description

---
### `pre_post_comparison_connected_lines_plot.py`
Generates rain cloud plot with connected lines comparing pre- and post-condition behavioural measures, saves figures to the `Plots/` directory.

### `percent_corr_demo.py`
Calculates percent change in behavioural measures and performs correlations
with demographic variables.

### `correlation_plots_with_demographics.py`
Generates correlation plots between behavioural and demographic variables.

### `centering.py`
Centers possbly colinear havioural variables and outputs centered CSV files for downstream analyses.

## Input / Intermediate Data

CSV and Excel files in the project root

May be overwritten when scripts are re-run

## Outputs

- Plots:  Figures are generated by the analysis scripts and saved locally in the `Plots/` directory; generated figures are not tracked by Git

- Tables: saved as CSV / Excel files

- GLMM Statistics: GLMM analyses were performed using JASP; project files are not included as they are derived from participant-level data.

## Notes

- Scripts assume the project root as the working directory
- All paths are defined relative to the project root
- Column names must match those expected by the scripts
- Re-running scripts may overwrite existing output files

Raw participant-level data are not included in this repository.
